This is the code of the [LoL Timer](http://loltimer.meteor.com) web application.

This application is a helper for [League of Legends](http://leagueoflegends.com), which allows you to easily put a timer on every monster camp, so you will be there exactly when they respawn.

You can share the timers in a room so every member of your team will be synchronized.


Libraries used
--------------

This project is based on [Meteor.js](http://meteor.com).

It also uses the [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) router for the URL management.
